# GraphQL Resolver Batching & Caching Demo üöÄ

Hey there! üëã Welcome to this little project exploring how to efficiently handle data fetching in GraphQL using Go. Specifically, we're diving into the **DataLoader pattern** with `gqlgen` and `dataloadgen` to tackle common performance bottlenecks like the N+1 query problem and to implement fine-grained control over data fetching within a single request, especially in subscriptions!

## ü§î What Are We Trying to Demo?

Imagine you have a GraphQL API where multiple fields might need the same piece of data (like fetching a user profile for different fields in a query). Or, consider a subscription where an update triggers multiple resolvers that all need the *exact same* external data for that single event. Making redundant calls to your database or external APIs can slow things down.

This project demonstrates how to:

1.  **Batch Requests:** Use a DataLoader to automatically group identical data requests made during a single GraphQL operation (query/mutation/subscription event) into a single batch call to the upstream source (like an API or database).
2.  **Cache Results (Request-Scoped):** The DataLoader also caches the results *for the duration of that single GraphQL operation*. If the same data is requested again during that operation, it's served directly from the cache.
3.  **Control "Single Flight" Behavior:** Implement custom logic (`singleFlight` parameter) to decide if subsequent requests for the same data *within the same operation* should return the cached value or explicitly return `nil`. This is particularly useful for subscriptions where you might want to ensure an action happens only *once* per received event.

## ‚ú® Design Concepts Explained

### 1. The DataLoader Pattern

At its core, DataLoader is about two things: **batching** and **caching**.

*   **Batching:** Instead of firing off individual requests like `getDate("AAPL")`, `getDate("MSFT")`, `getDate("AAPL")` all separately, DataLoader collects the unique keys ("AAPL", "MSFT") and makes a single batch call like `getDates(["AAPL", "MSFT"])`. This massively reduces the load on downstream services, especially when dealing with lists or nested structures.
*   **Caching:** Once `getDates(["AAPL", "MSFT"])` returns, the DataLoader stores the results (e.g., `AAPL -> date1`, `MSFT -> date2`) in a short-lived, request-scoped cache. If another resolver during the *same* GraphQL request asks for `getDate("AAPL")` again, DataLoader instantly returns `date1` from its cache without making another network call.

Here's a simplified view of how it works:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant R1 as Resolver 1 (Req Key A)
    participant R2 as Resolver 2 (Req Key B)
    participant R3 as Resolver 3 (Req Key A)
    participant DL as DataLoader
    participant BatchFn as Batch Function
    participant Source as Data Source (DB/API)

    R1->>+DL: Load(Key A)
    R2->>+DL: Load(Key B)
    R3->>+DL: Load(Key A)  # Second request for Key A

    Note over DL: Collects unique keys: [A, B]
    Note over DL: Schedules batch function call

    DL->>+BatchFn: fetch([A, B])
    BatchFn->>+Source: Get data for A, B
    Source-->>-BatchFn: Results for A, B
    BatchFn-->>-DL: Return results Map{A: ValA, B: ValB}

    Note over DL: Caches results: Map{A: ValA, B: ValB}

    DL-->>-R1: Return ValA
    DL-->>-R2: Return ValB
    DL-->>-R3: Return ValA (from cache) # Cache hit!
```

We use the [`vikstrous/dataloadgen`](https://github.com/vikstrous/dataloadgen) library to generate a type-safe DataLoader implementation based on our needs.

### 2. Request-Scoped Context

How does the DataLoader know when a "request" starts and ends? We use Go's `context.Context`!

*   An HTTP middleware (`internal/loaders/Middleware`) is injected into the request chain.
*   For each incoming HTTP request (or WebSocket connection for subscriptions), this middleware creates a *new* instance of our `DividendDateLoader`.
*   This fresh loader instance (with its own empty cache and attempt tracker) is added to the `context.Context` for that specific request.
*   Resolvers down the line can then pull this request-specific loader from the context (`loaders.For(ctx)`).

This ensures that batching and caching are isolated to the current GraphQL operation and don't leak between different users or requests.

### 3. The `singleFlight` Control Flag

Sometimes, just caching isn't enough. In subscriptions, you might receive an event for "AAPL", and multiple parts of your GraphQL subscription resolver might ask for its dividend date. Standard DataLoader caching would return the date every time.

But what if you only want the *first* access within that event processing cycle to get the date, and all others to get `nil` (perhaps to prevent redundant side effects)? That's where our custom logic comes in:

*   We added a `singleFlight: Boolean` argument to the `NextExDividendDate` field in our schema (`internal/schema/schema.graphql`).
*   Inside our custom loader (`internal/loaders/dataloaders.go`), we added an `attemptTracker`.
*   **If `singleFlight` is `true` (default):** We check the `attemptTracker`. If the key has already been processed *in the current request/event scope*, we return `nil` immediately. If not, we mark it as attempted and proceed to the dataloader (`d.loader.Load`).
*   **If `singleFlight` is `false`:** We check the `attemptTracker`. If this is the first time processing the key *in the current scope*, we mark it as attempted. Regardless of whether it was already attempted or not, **we always proceed to the dataloader (`d.loader.Load`)**. This allows the dataloader's internal cache (L1) or the shared cache (L2, via the batch function) to return the value on subsequent accesses within the same request/event.

This `attemptTracker` lives alongside the dataloader cache within the `DividendDateLoader` struct, making it request-scoped as well.

Here's a flowchart illustrating the interaction between the middleware, our custom loader logic (including `singleFlight` and the attempt tracker), and the underlying `dataloadgen` behavior:

```mermaid

**Diagram Explanation (Project Flow):**

1.  **Request/Event Scope:** An incoming request/event starts the process. The `Middleware` creates a unique `DividendDateLoader` instance for this scope. This instance holds both the `dataloadgen.Loader` (L1 Cache + Batching) and our `SymbolAttemptTracker`.
2.  **Resolver Execution:** The resolver gets the scope-specific loader from the context.
3.  **Attempt Check:** It calls `LoadDividendDate`, which first checks the `SymbolAttemptTracker`.
4.  **Early Nil:** If the key *was* already attempted in this scope *and* `singleFlight` is true, it returns `nil` immediately.
5.  **Mark Attempt:** If it's the first attempt in this scope, it marks the key in the `SymbolAttemptTracker`.
6.  **L1 Cache Check:** The code proceeds to call `dataloadgenLoader.Load(key)`. The dataloader library checks its internal request-scoped cache (L1). If HIT, it returns the cached value.
7.  **Batch Function Trigger (L1 Miss):** If L1 misses, the key is queued. Later, the `Batch Function` (`fetchDividendDates`) runs.
8.  **L2 Cache Check:** Inside the batch function, the shared `go-cache` (L2) is checked. If HIT, the value is returned.
9.  **API Call (L2 Miss):** If L2 misses, the (simulated) API call is made.
10. **Cache Updates:** The result from the API is stored in the L2 cache (shared) and then returned to the dataloader, which stores it in the L1 cache (request-scoped).
11. **Return Value:** The final value is returned to the resolver.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Implementation Details

*   **GraphQL Framework:** [`gqlgen`](https://gqlgen.com/) handles the heavy lifting of parsing GraphQL requests, mapping them to resolvers, and generating Go types from our schema. Configuration is in `gqlgen.yml`.
*   **DataLoader Generator:** [`vikstrous/dataloadgen`](https://github.com/vikstrous/dataloadgen) generates the type-safe dataloader code (`internal/loaders/dataloaders.go`) based on a batch function (`fetchDividendDates`).
*   **Schema:** Defined in `internal/schema/schema.graphql`.
*   **Generated Code:** `gqlgen` and `dataloadgen` output generated code into `internal/gen/`. **Don't edit this directly!**
*   **Root Resolver Structure:** `internal/graph/resolver.go` defines the main `Resolver` struct (where you'd inject dependencies like DB connections) and methods that connect to the different resolver types.
*   **Resolver Implementations:**
    *   `internal/graph/query_resolver.go`: Implements Query resolvers.
    *   `internal/graph/subscription_resolver.go`: Implements Subscription resolvers.
    *   `internal/graph/symbol_definition_resolver.go`: Implements resolvers for fields on the `SymbolDefinition` type.
    *   These implementations delegate the actual business logic to functions in `internal/resolvers/`.
*   **Dataloader Logic:** `internal/loaders/dataloaders.go` contains the `DividendDateLoader` struct (wrapping the generated loader), the `SymbolAttemptTracker` for `singleFlight` logic, the `Middleware` for context injection, and the `fetchDividendDates` batch function simulation.
*   **Shared Memory Cache:** `internal/cache/cache.go` implements a package-level shared memory cache (using `patrickmn/go-cache`) with a default 5-minute TTL. The `fetchDividendDates` batch function checks this cache before simulating API calls.
*   **Actual Resolver Logic:** `internal/resolvers/` contains the Go functions that perform the work for each resolver field, using the dataloader fetched from the context.
*   **Server Entrypoint:** `cmd/server/main.go` sets up the HTTP server, wires up the `gqlgen` handler, adds transports (including WebSockets for subscriptions), and injects the dataloader middleware.
*   **Tool Dependencies:** `tools/tools.go` uses Go's build constraint mechanism to track versions of command-line tools like `gqlgen` used during development.
*   **Build Automation:** `Makefile` provides handy commands (`make gen`, `make build`, `make run`, `make clean`).

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Build and Run

Getting this up and running is easy peasy! You'll need Go (check `go.mod` for the version, 1.23.8+ recommended) and Make installed.

1.  **Install Go Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    # Fetches the necessary Go packages
    go mod tidy
    ```

2.  **Generate Code:**
    This runs `gqlgen` and `dataloadgen` based on the schema and config.
    ```bash
    # Generates code in internal/gen/
    make gen
    ```
    *(You only need to run this if you change the GraphQL schema or dataloader definitions).*

3.  **Build the Server:**
    ```bash
    # Compiles the Go code into an executable
    make build
    ```
    This creates `./bin/server`.

4.  **Run the Server:**
    ```bash
    # Starts the GraphQL server
    ./bin/server
    # Or use the make target:
    # make run
    ```

üéâ **Server is now running!** By default, it's on port `8080`.

*   **GraphQL Playground:** Head to [http://localhost:8080/playground](http://localhost:8080/playground) in your browser for an interactive API explorer.
*   **GraphQL Endpoint:** The actual endpoint for programmatic access is [http://localhost:8080/query](http://localhost:8080/query).

### Example Queries & Subscriptions

You can try these in the Playground:

**Basic Query (implicitly uses `singleFlight: true`)**
```graphql
query GetSymbols {
  symbols(names: ["AAPL", "GOOG"]) {
    Name
    NextExDividendDate
  }
}
```

**Subscription (using `singleFlight: true` to get `nil` after first access per event)**
```graphql
subscription StreamSymbolUpdates {
  symbolUpdates(names: ["AAPL", "GOOG"]) {
    Name
    NextExDividendDate(singleFlight: true)
  }
}
```

Check the server logs (`./bin/server`) while running these - they provide insight into when the simulated `fetchDividendDates` function is actually called versus when the dataloader cache or the `singleFlight` logic kicks in!

### Understanding the Logs (Examples)

To really see the magic happen, run the server (`./bin/server` or `make run`) and execute the example queries/subscriptions in the Playground ([http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)). Watch the terminal where you launched the server!

**1. Basic Query Logs (`singleFlight: true` implicit)**

When you run this subscription:

```graphql
subscription StreamSymbolUpdates {
  symbolUpdates(names: ["AAPL", "GOOG"]) {
    Name
    NextExDividendDate(singleFlight: true)
  }
}
```

You'll get periodic updates.
You should see logs similar to this (timestamps and exact order might vary slightly):

```log
YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS Query.symbols called with 2 symbols
YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS Symbol AAPL first attempt (singleFlight=true), marked as attempted. Fetching...
YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS Symbol GOOG first attempt (singleFlight=true), marked as attempted. Fetching...
# --- Dataloader batch function starts ---
YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS Simulating AAPL dividend date for AAPL
YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS Simulating GOOG dividend date for GOOG
# --- Dataloader batch function ends ---
YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS Symbol AAPL already attempted with singleFlight=true, returning nil
YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS Symbol GOOG already attempted with singleFlight=true, returning nil
```

**Explanation:**

*   `Subscription.symbolUpdates called with 2 symbols`: The top-level query resolver runs.
*   `Symbol ... first attempt`: The `NextExDividendDate` resolver is called for the *first* instance of each unique symbol (`AAPL`, `GOOG`). Our `LoadDividendDate` function logs this and marks them as attempted.
*   `Simulating...`: The `fetchDividendDates` batch function runs *once* with the unique keys (`AAPL`, `GOOG`). Notice `AAPL` is only fetched once, even though it was requested twice in the query! This is the DataLoader **batching** in action.
*   `Symbol AAPL already attempted... returning nil`: When the resolver encounters the *second* `AAPL` in the query list, our `LoadDividendDate` function sees it was already attempted (because `singleFlight` defaults to true) and correctly returns `nil` as per the logic we added.

The key takeaway for subscriptions is that the dataloader and the attempt tracker are **scoped to each event processing cycle**, providing fresh state for every message pushed to the client, while still allowing fine-grained control *within* that cycle using `singleFlight`.
